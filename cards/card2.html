            Famously known as 'Heaven on Earth, Srinagar is located in the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir, on the banks of river Jhelum. Known for its serene lakes, lush gardens, and Mughal-era architecture, Srinagar is a timeless destination that beckons travelers from around the world. Srinagar is known for the stationary houseboats and gondola-type rowboats- Shikaras on Dal Lake. Adorned with tranquil Dal Lake & Nigeen Lake, Srinagar is the dream destination for honeymoon and family holidays. 

            The tourists use Shikaras to see attractions like the Floating Vegetable Market and the Mir Bahris â€“ a lively community of people who live on the lake itself. In addition, there are a lot of houseboats that provide a beautiful and unique stay experience on the lake. Srinagar is home to some of India's most exquisite Mughal-age gardens, with the top attractions being Nishat Bagh, Shalimar Bagh and Chashm-E-Shahi Garden. It is also home to Asia's largest tulip garden.
